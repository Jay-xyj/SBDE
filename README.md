# SBDE: A Segmentation-driven Editing Framework for Bolt Defect Augmentation and Detection
Official repository for SBDE: A Segmentation-driven Editing Framework for Bolt Defect Augmentation and Detection

## We are developing an online demo on HuggingFace

## Online Demo will be released soon (Recommended).

This example shows the test results of our method on a bolt image selected from the public paper. Example of the bolt image from [UBDDM](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10036038) *Luo P, Wang B, Wang H, et al. An ultrasmall bolt defect detection method for transmission line inspection[J]. IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, 2023, 72: 1-12.*

## Requirements
*Python 3.8 

*PyTorch 2.4.1

## Todo
This code combines different tasks and is quite complex. We will organize this work in the future.
